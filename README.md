# Unity Shader Guide

Welcome!

Writing shaders can be intimidating to beginners. This guide aims to serve as a step-by-step introduction to shader writing by providing thoroughly commented examples.

This guide covers the fundamentals of surface shaders, vertex & fragment shaders, and compute shaders. You will start with a simple, color-changing sphere, and build your way up to creating more complicated shaders such as ray-tracing and fractals.

The code in this guide are aimed to be clear and instructional, and might not be optimized. Optimizing the code will be up to you.
